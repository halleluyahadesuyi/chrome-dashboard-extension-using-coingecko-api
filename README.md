# Chrome-Dashboard-Extension-
This is a Chrome extension used to display a dashboard containing random background photos, coin values, and some weather info based on one's current location.

Installation:
Navigate to "More Tools", then "Extensions" on Chrome, and turn on the "Developer mode" slider. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the forked repo to load the extension on a Chrome page. 

Note: Since this app is location- based, be sure to have your device's location visible before installation.
